# Starbucks_Capstone
This exploration is the final project challenge from the Data Scientist Nanodegree in Udacity. The dataset to be dealt with is simulated data on how customers make purchases and how their decisions might be affected by promotional offers of Starbucks. People in the simulation are provided with three different types of offers: 1. buy-one-get-one(BOGO), 2. discount and 3. informational. They produced various events, like receiving the offers, viewing the offers and possibly making purchases. Each person will have his or her own hidden traits on their purchasing patterns. The goal of this project is to identify groups of people that share similar purchasing patterns and if they are influenced by promotional offers.

# Getting Started: 
Please make sure you have a python 3.x version and the following packages installed, before you can launch the code:
  1. seaborn
  2. sklearn
  
# How to install?:
  - Download the data.zip and upzip it. 
  - Download the ipython notebook file. 
  - The notebook needs to be in the same directory with the 'data' folder. 'data' folder should contains profile.json, portfolio.json and transcript.json
